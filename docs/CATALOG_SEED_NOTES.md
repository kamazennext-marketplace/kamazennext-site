# Catalog Seed Notes

## Pricing placeholder

Pricing is set to `Varies` as a safe placeholder to avoid implying specific costs before verified pricing details are available.

## Renderer-required fields

Renderers expect these fields to be present:

- `slug`
- `id`
- `name`
- `category`
- `tagline`
- `website`
- `api`
- `pricing`
- `audience`

## Next steps

- [ ] Add official website URLs (TODO)
- [ ] Add logos
- [ ] Add screenshots
